# Wine Quality – Acidity Analysis  
**UBC STAT 201 Group Project**

This project was completed as part of the STAT 201 course at the University of British Columbia.  
We investigated whether there is a statistically significant difference in acidity (pH levels) between red and white variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine.

---

## 📊 Objective

We tested the hypothesis that red and white wines have different mean pH levels.  
Using statistical inference techniques, we explored acidity levels using two-sample confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.
